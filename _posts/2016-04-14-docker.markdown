## Attending

Anyone interested in learning about    
1) using the container technology called `Docker` to capture software deployment for    

* building reproducible scientific software and / or
* teaching and /or
* apps on the cloud 

2) how to update the `HackerWithin` Davis chapter website and use the fancy web
framework `Jekyll`

## Capturing software builds with `Docker` [[Karen Ng](karenyyng.github.io)]
As software gets more and more complicated nowadays, `Docker`
provides safe encapsulated environments to capture the requirements,
installation and deployment steps. Gone are the days when one has to spend hours to read
through manuals and stack-overflow to build a piece of software, only to find the build 
broke other software on the machine. 
In this talk, I will explain how `Docker` works and why it is more lightweight
than virtual machines. Then we will have some fun building and hacking the 
`HackerWithin` Davis chapter website using `Docker`. If we have time left
during the hands-on session, we can also pull the `Docker` image of `Hortonworks Data
Platform` to play with `Hadoop` or the `Jupyter` stack image to play with `Spark
notebooks`.

### Short bio
I am a Physics PhD final year student eager to learn about different data
technologies. I have just completed two internships related to scalable data
analytics. The first one was at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab., where I built an
end-to-end data analytics pipeline with `Spark` and `Hadoop`. The second one was at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab. (NERSC), where I worked on parallelizing the computation of an astrophysics 
project. I am looking for good data science career opportunities to utilize my
analytics skills. 


### Prerequisites

* Git, 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 
* [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (if you do not have Linux as your OS)

After installing `Docker`, you can test that it work by starting the `Docker daemon`. 

For Linux users, executing: 
```
$ sudo docker -d &
```
will start the `Docker` daemon in the background. 

For Mac and Windows users, run the `Docker daemon`
by looking for an application called `Docker quickstart terminal` and start it. 

After the `Docker` daemon is up and running (in the `quickstart terminal`), 
execute:

```bash
$ docker pull karenyng/hackerwithin_dockerfile
```

To download the `Docker` file that we are going to use.
(Linux users may need prepend `sudo` to the above command.)
 
Attendees should also be familiar with basic shell commands and a text editor on their laptops.

### Data Science in the Intensive Care Unit [Greg Rehm]
Greg Rehm is a UC Davis Computer Science Masters Student. He will talk about gathering patient data in hospital ICUs and what we can do with that data to improve quality of care.
